event tracker 
node js application
--- not fully implemented
--- did not add routers for node js .. therefore 2 servers need to be run one for client(simple python http server will do) and one for server(npm hello.js) (cors enabled . so no problem)
--- eventio.sql contains db
--- hello.js in node js server code
--- main.html and main.js are the client code
ajax added for requests
